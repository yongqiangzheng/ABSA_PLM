The best thing on the $T$ was probably the creamed spinach side and that's saying alot for a steakhouse.

Unfortunately it gets very crowded on the weekends, so if you don't mind $T$ at the bar you can skip the wait for a table.

The $T$ was quite bland, and the saag paneer was a huge disappointment--more like some kid's worst experience of creamed spinach with tofu-like cheese.

I thought the service was a little slow and not attentive enough for the $T$ but other than that I'll be back when I can afford to spend $60 on dinner!

The downside is that perhaps due to $T$ 's eclectic nature, the chef has trouble cooking any single type to perfection.

My friends and I dropped by on a Sunday, and there was absolutely NO $T$ (the supposed only female bartender even told us there was no one else but her, and given that there were people in there waiting to dine and drink, that was ridicoulas!

We loved the recommendation for the $T$ , and I think the eggplant parmigiana appetizer should become an entree.

The $T$ sounded good but the grilled eggplant roll was oversauced with a pile of mint, pork chop was leathery, and everything just tasted wrong.

$T$ is coddling and correct and there's no sense of hurry, so diners linger over a cheese course or a round of liqueurs.
